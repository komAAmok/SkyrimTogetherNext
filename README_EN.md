This repository builds on the open-source Skyrim Together framework to support more game versions and Mods (mod packs), plus a richer companion-plugin ecosystem, for a more immersive multiplayer experience.

This repository extends the upstream [TiltedEvolution](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/TiltedEvolution) with several practical capabilities:

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple game versions**: Full 1.6.x line (1.6.1170 / 1.6.640, etc.), new 1.7.x builds (1.7.99 / 1.7.104), and **legacy 1.5.x (including 1.5.97)** — address libraries and ID mapping tables are all bundled;
- **Seamless MO2 + SKSE launch**: Ships as an SKSE plugin; launch `skse64_loader.exe` normally through Mod Organizer 2 and the mod loads automatically, with a **self-deploying runtime** — on first launch the required files are deployed to the game root automatically, no manual copying needed;
- **Guided graphical installer (Chinese / English)**: The mod package embeds a FOMOD installer (natively supported by MO2). The first step picks Chinese or English and the remaining steps follow that choice; multiplayer files install automatically, leaving only the genuinely optional choices to you - two framework options (1.6.x launch validation script, standalone launcher) plus **six companion plugins**, each with a one-line explanation. Installing none of them changes nothing about multiplayer;
- **Six companion plugins included**: OStimTogether (scene sync), MorphSyncTogether (body morph and overlay sync), IEDSyncTogether (equipment display sync), AnimSyncTogether (animation graph variable and event sync), DAVSyncTogether (Dynamic Armor Variants appearance sync) and TradeTogether (player-to-player item and gold trading) ship inside the same archive and are picked in the installer. No separate downloads, and no ports to open or forward. Each plugin's add-ons (OCum, PPA, body-hair overlay packs and so on) expand in the same wizard;
- **Graphical server control panel**: The Windows dedicated server ships with a minimal GUI (status / player count / logs / start-stop buttons); pass `--nogui` to fall back to pure console mode;
- **LAN multiplayer out of the box**: The networking layer is pure UDP / GameNetworkingSockets, with no Steam dependency — works over LAN, Radmin LAN, Hamachi, public VPS / Docker, or any other network topology;
- **Automatic release builds**: Pushing a tag triggers a Windows build in GitHub Actions and publishes two packages — `SkyrimTogetherNextMod-<version>` (client mod) and `SkyrimTogetherNextServer-<version>` (dedicated server).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Players)

1. Download the two zips (Mod package and Server package with matching version numbers) from this repo's [Releases](../../releases);
2. **Host**: Unzip the Server package and run `SkyrimTogetherServer.exe` (graphical UI, listens on UDP 10578 by default — remember to allow it through the firewall);
3. **All players (including the host)**: Install the Mod package via MO2 "Install from file" (the install wizard pops up), or unzip manually into the game `Data/`; launch SKSE through MO2;
4. In-game, press **F2** to bring up the multiplayer menu and connect to `<host IP>:10578`.

For illustrated LAN / Radmin instructions, see [docs/LAN-RADMIN-GUIDE.md](docs/LAN-RADMIN-GUIDE.md).

## 📦 Supported Game Versions

| Game version | SKSE | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5.3 ~ 1.5.97 (old SE) | SKSE 2.0.x | Fully supported: see note below |
| 1.6.317 ~ 1.6.1179 | SKSE 2.1.x / 2.2.x | Works out of the box (recommended) |
| 1.7.99 / 1.7.104 | New SKSE | Works out of the box (format 5 address library) |

> **1.5.x support note**: 1.5.x (including 1.5.97) is fully supported. The AE ID → 1.5.x offset translation tables for 10 versions are bundled; address mapping coverage is **99.6%** (3069 of the 3082 addresses referenced in code are resolved), and all 3698 mappings can be found in the official address library `version-1-5-97-0.bin`; the remaining 13 (near-twin functions, modules with no callers, debug views) safely degrade at runtime (empty stub / RTTI null-pointer guard / skip patch) and will not crash. The manifest and individual impact are documented in [Tools/missing_1_5_97_ids.txt](Tools/missing_1_5_97_ids.txt).
>
> Only one of the 13 is player-visible (`32883`, which leaves the animation graph
> un-reverted when a remote player's animation is replayed); the rest are debug views,
> debugger thread names and modules with no callers. **Function ids and data ids
> degrade differently**: an unmapped *function* id resolves to a stub that returns
> zero when called, so calling it is safe; an unmapped *data* id dereferenced the
> ordinary way would read that stub's own machine code, so every such id is resolved
> with `FindAddressById` instead and degrades on failure.
>
> **1.5.x structures**: The package bundles a **second runtime DLL** (`SkyrimTogetherRuntime_1_5.dll`). It is compiled from the same source as the one used for 1.6.x / 1.7.x, but with the `SKYRIM_TARGET_LEGACY` conditional compilation selecting the 1.5.x structure layout (typically 8 bytes smaller than 1.6.x — 1.5.x's `ExtraDataList` has no vtable; `TESObjectCELL` is missing three trailing members, a 32-byte difference). The SKSE bootstrap plugin picks one automatically based on the game version. The layout is validated member-by-member at **compile time** via `static_assert`, not "compiled against 1.6.x and hoped it matches at runtime".

## ⚠️ Known Conflicting Mods

The following mods conflict with this framework. Installing them causes crashes, UI glitches, or broken functionality, so **do not enable them at the same time**:

| Mod name | Link | Chinese alias |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Floating Subtitles | https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154424 | 浮动字幕 |

> **Floating Subtitles (po3_FloatingSubtitles)**: This mod's trampoline stub jumps into an unallocated memory page and crashes the game outright when entering a room / preparing to connect. If you hit a crash on room entry, disable this mod first. If you genuinely need subtitle functionality, use an alternative implementation or wait for an upstream fix.

## 🧩 Supported Mod Packs

The following mod pack has been validated for multiplayer and can be used with this framework directly:

| Mod pack | Link | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 神话整合 (Magic Skyrim) | https://magicskyrim.net/ | Under testing |
| Nolvus v6 | https://www.nolvus.net/ | Under testing |

> If you hit a crash, please attach the logs described below. 
>
> If a pack ships animation / behavior mods that collide with this framework's behavior-variable replacement, you will see `BehaviorVar::Patch` lines in the log.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

Please open an issue in the repo's "Issues" page, attaching reproducible steps, game version, SKSE version, and server logs. Detailed reports are very important for development.

**Log locations (under the game root directory):**

| Log | Path | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client log | `<game root>\logs\tp_client.log` | Core multiplayer log: connection, sync, and crash stacks |
| UI log | `<game root>\logs\cef_debug.log` | F2 overlay (CEF) errors |

> When running multiple clients the logs are named `tp_client_instance_2.log`, `tp_client_instance_3.log`, and so on;
> the server log is `logs/STServerOut.log`. For crash reports, please include the full excerpt around the crash.

## 📜 Version History

| Version | Date | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1.1.4** | 2026-09-26 | **Upstream v1.8.2 synced, with two rewrites for this fork's multi-version logic**: #899 (rebuild a leveled NPC from the original placed NPC plus the owner's pick, preserving non-inherited data such as hold guard names and outfits) and #893 (exclude per-faction jail containers, or one player's belongings land in another player's chest) are both ported; neither 1.5.x rewrite is a guess - the `GarbageCollector` singleton (id `400329`) and `SetLeveledCreature` (id `20231`) have **no mapping** on 1.5.97, so copying upstream would have dereferenced the zero-returning stub and spun a per-frame Disable/Enable loop respectively, and both now resolve through the address library with a `CanRecordPick()` gate; the one unguarded `GetByConnectionId` dereference in `CommandService::OnSetTimeCommand` is fixed (**any player could crash a dedicated server with a single `/settime`**); the transport description in `docs/COMPANION-PLUGINS.md`, which said the **opposite** of the shipped value, is corrected and now pinned by a gate; and the coverage figure is recounted properly - `collect_codebase_ids()` had skipped all 301 `.h` files and counted commented-out calls as live, so the number is now **3069/3082 (99.6%)** |
| **1.1.3** | 2026-09-26 | **The companion-plugin ecosystem lands**: the three remaining plugins are integrated by the same recipe - `AnimSyncTogether` (animation graph variable/event sync), `DAVSyncTogether` (Dynamic Armor Variants appearance sync) and `TradeTogether` (player-to-player item and gold trading), taking the optional set from three to **six**, with submodules, the consumer contract, the packaging manifest, the CI build, the durable snapshots and the installer wizard all updated together; the OStim wizard notice whose **two routes were both dead ends** is gone (upstream has no release and no tag, and the script it named never enters a package), leaving both languages describing the feature and nothing else; a **release blocker this work introduced itself** is fixed - two plugins pin a vcpkg baseline the CI's `--depth 1` clone cannot resolve, and vcpkg's builtin-registry path has **no fetch fallback**, so the baselines are now derived from the manifests and fetched before bootstrap; **OStim's two Papyrus scripts can finally be built**: the open-source `russo-2025/papyrus-compiler` (pinned tag plus SHA-256) with twelve base-type stubs added in this repository, because `plugins/` is a gitlink, so `OSKSE.pex` and `OStimTogetherNative.pex` ship and the **Add Actor consent gate actually works**; along the way `OStimTogether_OCum.esp` was found **shipping without its script** (four `Form` and one `Game` stub added, `OStimTogetherOCum.pex` wired into the same compile path) and the packaging script now honours **artifacts declared on a sub-option**, which it used to ignore silently; the ten shipping scripts under `GameFiles/Skyrim/scripts/source/` gained a reproducible compile entry point, and `SkyrimTogetherVerifyLaunchScript.psc` lost a `\n` escape the compiler does not implement and would have **emitted literally while reporting success**; the papyrus-compiler source is archived under `snapshots/tools/` behind a gate |
| **1.1.2** | 2026-09-26 | Fourth audit round plus a companion-plugin pass: fixed a remotely triggerable server crash (a second authentication request dereferenced a null player), and 20-odd null dereferences across `PlayerService`, `DiscoveryService`, `WeatherService`, `OverlayService` and `CalculateHealthPercentage`; the plugin layer's **ProxyResolver mapping listeners were never fired** (both `OStimTogether` and `IEDSyncTogether` register one) and now are, driven by `PlayerComponent` construction and destruction; `setLogCallback` was stored and never called and the server's rate-limit buckets grew without bound, both fixed; **F2 is the only in-game hotkey** (right Ctrl/F3/F4/F6/F7/F8 commented out or disabled); the 34 address-library files deleted by accident are restored, covering 1.5.x and 1.6.x/1.7.x |
| **1.1.1** | 2026-09-25 | Third audit round: fixed a chained dereference of a cell that is null for the whole of a load in `VisitInteriorCell`, three consecutive dereferences of the player in `Actor::Create`, and an unchecked `Actor::Create` result in `DebugService`; also corrected the guard order in `Actor::Create`, which leaked the actor it had already allocated |
| **1.1.0** | 2026-09-25 | **Performance & sync**: interpolation switched to Catmull-Rom with bounded extrapolation (removes the polyline feel and the freeze-then-snap on packet loss); frame loop 16 to 8 ms, roughly doubling the update rate; movement updates drop from O(updates x entities) to linear; fixed an engine null dereference caused by spawning one remote player twice; repository-wide `GetById` dereference audit fixing 15 unguarded dereferences; **self-deploy false failures fixed**: content comparison replaces the timestamp test (mtime now only a pre-filter) and a `.str_old` cleanup for a file that is never created is gone (it polluted the error code into `error 2`); timer quantisation measured (16 ms request is really 31.25 ms) |
