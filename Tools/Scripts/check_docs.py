"""Keep the documentation honest about the numbers it states.

CODE_GUIDELINES.md makes documentation part of every version change. That rule is
only worth writing down if something checks it, because every claim this file
verifies has already drifted at least once:

  * the 1.5.x coverage figure was recounted by hand and published as 3080/3075
    while the generator said something else
  * Tools/ida/README.md and docs/LAN-RADMIN-GUIDE.md still quoted the old totals
    after the generator was fixed
  * v1.1.4 shipped with no README row in either language, so the version table
    and the changelog disagreed about which versions exist

Each check below compares a claim in prose against the file that owns the value,
rather than against another paragraph. Where a number has a single source, the
source is read; where a set has a single source, the set is counted.

    python Tools/Scripts/check_docs.py          # the gate
    python Tools/Scripts/check_docs.py --list   # show what is checked
